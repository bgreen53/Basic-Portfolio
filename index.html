<h2>About Me</h2>

<hr color="black"> 

<img src="assets/images/200.png">
<p>I attended high school in the small town of Hackleburg, Alabama. It was there that I took a business tech essentials class that led to my love for html and, eventually, coding.
    There have been many detours along the way but I am finally working in the Information Technology field and futher pursuing my dream of becoming a developer
